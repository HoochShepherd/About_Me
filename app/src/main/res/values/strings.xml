    <string name="bio">Hey, my name is Adam.
        \n\nI have two kids, two cats that I\'m allergic to, two lizards, and a flying squirrel.
        \n\nAfter getting a philosophy degree from a now defunct school, I spent years fixing mowers
        and other small engines. At the time I was a single dad of one and barely treading water, so
        I decided to get a degree some one would want. Two years later I got my Computer Science
        degree, an amazing wife, and a second kid.\n\nNow I am learning kotlin app development to
        make up for my lack of practical experience, with the goal getting a job in app
        developement!</string>
